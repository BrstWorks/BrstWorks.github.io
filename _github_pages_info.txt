# BrstWorks GitHub Pages Configuration

# This file ensures GitHub Pages builds correctly
# No additional configuration needed for basic static site

# The site uses:
# - Standard HTML/CSS/JS (no Jekyll processing needed)
# - All files in root directory
# - index.html as main entry point

# GitHub Pages will automatically:
# 1. Detect this as a static site
# 2. Serve index.html as the homepage
# 3. Make all assets available via their paths
# 4. Enable HTTPS automatically
# 5. Provide a custom domain option

# To deploy:
# 1. Push all files to your GitHub repository
# 2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
# 3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
# 4. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)"
# 5. Save and wait for deployment

# Your site will be available at:
# https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/
